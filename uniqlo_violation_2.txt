5 Fast-Fashion Brands Called Out for Greenwashing
As one of the most known fast fashion companies in the world, it comes as no surprise that the Japanese retailer Uniqlo appears in the list of greenwashing fashion companies. Much like other fast fashion companies, Uniqlo has had multiple labour rights violations and complaints.

With over 3,000 stores across the world, and items produced with a significant amount of cheap synthetic materials – including rayon, polyester, nylon, and elastane – and sold at very low costs, the brand’s sustainability reputation isn’t the greatest either. 

In recent years, however, Uniqlo has taken more sustainable approaches, such as focusing on technologies to create new clothing from recycled materials to developing energy-efficient infrastructure and supporting the Setouchi Olive Foundation, which aims to protect and restore the coastal areas and islands of Japan’s Seto Inland Sea. “For more than 20 years, Uniqlo has been on a path to sustainability. As a global company creating responsible clothing, we are committed to a healthy planet, society, and people.” – the company’s website reads.

Yet, a lack of transparency has sparked accusations of greenwashing. First of all, Uniqlo does not present any certification for their textiles. But the real issue is that, despite setting a climate change target to reduce emissions in its supply chain, to this day the Japanese brand fails to report on its progress or disclose implementation settings. Its environmental targets have also not been scientifically approved, which makes it extremely tricky to determine whether they are in line with national and international climate policies.
